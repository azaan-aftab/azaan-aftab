The app supports text messaging, image sharing, and emoji reactions, ensuring smooth and engaging conversations. It utilizes Firebase Google Authentication for secure user login and a real-time database for instant message delivery. The UI is clean and user-friendly, designed for a seamless chatting experience. 🚀 

🔹 **[Project 2 MOLA HUB](https://github.com/DivDash/molahub)** – MolaHub is more than just a coffee app—it's a social experience! The app revolves around three key interactions:
🔹 Share a Mola – Send coffee tokens as a gift by purchasing them physically at a coffee shop.
🔹 Meet via Mola – Connect with people at coffee shops and spark new conversations.
🔹 Share with Mola – Engage in real-time chat with strangers after a physical meet-and-greet, making every coffee moment more meaningful.

Built with Flutter and powered by real-time chat, MolaHub blends coffee culture with social networking, creating a unique way to meet, share, and connect. 🚀☕
